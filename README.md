# Firefly

Firefly is an engaging 2D platformer that immerses players in the role of a protagonist endowed with incredible fireball superpowers. Tasked with breaking the grip of an endless winter, your character embarks on a captivating journey to warm up the world.

Beyond merely hurling fireballs, the protagonist can launch himself using these fiery projectiles, propelling across vast distances and reaching new heights. The game seamlessly blends platforming challenges with environmental puzzles, requiring players to strategically utilize their fireball powers not only to thaw obstacles but also to navigate complex terrains. With the ability to perform powerful leaps and mid-air maneuvers, the protagonist can discover hidden areas, access previously unreachable platforms, and unveil the secrets of the frozen realm.

## How to Play

As of right now you need to download the code and run it in Godot. As we get more content we intend to bundle and release an executable file that can be downloaded and ran to play without godot.
